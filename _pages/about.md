<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the prestigious Dual Degree Ph.D. Program jointly offered by the Department of Computing at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and the School of Artificial Intelligence at Nankai University. I am under the joint supervision of <a href='https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/'>Prof. Cao Jiannong</a> and <a href='https://farlab.nankai.edu.cn/FACULTY_STAFFS.htm'>Prof. Wang Hongpeng</a>. 

My current research is primarily focused on Embodied AI, leveraging Spatial Intelligence and Multimodal learning to advance Imitation Learning and address uncertainty and optimization challenges in sequential decision-making. My broader expertise spans key areas including Deep Learning, Meta-Learning, Few-Shot Learning, and Uncertainty Quantification. I actively seek to translate theoretical advancements into robust, real-world Embodied AI applications.

Further broadening my international research experience, I received funding via the <strong>Research Student Attachment Programme (RSAP, PolyU)</strong> for a visiting research position (Research Postgraduate) at <strong>Imperial College London</strong> (Department of Computing). I will be attached to the <a href="https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/aese/" target="_blank">AESE research group</a> from <strong>July to November 2025</strong>, under the supervision of <a href="https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/aese/people/julie-a-mccann/" target="_blank">Prof. Julie A. McCann</a>.

My foundational academic journey in Software Engineering began at Shandong Normal University (B.S.) and the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) (M.S.). During my Master’s studies, I was fortunate to conduct research under the guidance of [Prof. Fan Zhou](https://sise.uestc.edu.cn/info/1035/9375.htm), [Prof. Ting Zhong](https://sise.uestc.edu.cn/info/1035/9374.htm), and [Prof. Jiahao Wang](https://sise.uestc.edu.cn/info/1036/5697.htm).
